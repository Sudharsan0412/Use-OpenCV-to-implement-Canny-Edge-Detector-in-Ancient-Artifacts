# Use-OpenCV-to-implement-Canny-Edge-Detector-in-Ancient-Artifacts
Canny edge detection algorithm is a multi-stage edge detection technique that has remained widely used due to its effectiveness in detecting sharp edges. The preservation, analysis, and digitization of ancient artifacts are crucial for cultural heritage and historical research. Ancient artifacts often have intricate textures, engravings, and inscriptions that provide valuable insights into historical civilizations. However, the complexity of these textures, coupled with deterioration over time, poses significant challenges for traditional image processing techniques. Edge detection is a fundamental process in image analysis, serving as a foundation for further operations such as feature extraction, pattern recognition, and object segmentation. This project, titled "Use OpenCV to Implement Canny Edge Detector in Ancient Artifacts," explores the implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using OpenCV to enhance the visibility of edges and contours in images of ancient artifacts, thereby improving their interpretability and analysis. One of the unique challenges in applying edge detection to artifact analysis is adapting the algorithm to handle complex textures and subtle edges that may not be prominent in standard edge detection applications.
